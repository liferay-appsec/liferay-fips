# It is highly recommended to disable HTTP and use a dedicated transport user for production.
# For FIPS, all transport should be secured with TLS.
# Example for enabling SSL/TLS (requires generating keystores):
# xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
# xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.path: certs/elastic-certificates.p12
# xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.path: certs/elastic-certificates.p12
